The AirLine-Reservation CRUD Web App is a web application designed to manage airline reservations. It supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing reservations, flights, and passengers.

## Architecture
This project follows an N-Tier architecture, which divides the application into the following layers:

**Presentation Layer:** This is the topmost layer that handles the user interface. It is implemented using ASP.NET MVC (Model-View-Controller).
Business Logic Layer (BLL): This layer contains the business logic of the application. It processes the data between the Presentation Layer and the Data Access Layer.
Data Access Layer (DAL): This layer is responsible for interacting with the database. It contains methods for CRUD operations.
Entities Layer: This layer contains the entity classes that represent the data model.
