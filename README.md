The AirLine-Reservation CRUD Web App is a web application designed to manage airline reservations. It supports  CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing reservations, flights, and passengers. We use the Database First Approach and Microsoft SQL Server for database management and LINQ queries for efficient data handling.

## Architecture
This project follows an N-Tier architecture, which divides the application into the following layers:

**Presentation Layer:** This is the topmost layer that handles the user interface. It is implemented using ASP.NET MVC (Model-View-Controller).
Business Logic Layer (BLL): This layer contains the business logic of the application. It processes the data between the Presentation Layer and the Data Access Layer.
Data Access Layer (DAL): This layer is responsible for interacting with the database. It contains methods for CRUD operations.
Entities Layer: This layer contains the entity classes that represent the data model.
